# Star-Type-Classification-NASA

Objective: The purpose of making the dataset is to prove that the stars follows a certain graph in the celestial Space , specifically called Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram. 

Solution: The dataset is created based on several equations in astrophysics by NASA Scientists. Performed EDA, feature engineering and apply a logistic regression to classify the stars like White Dwarf, Red Dwarf, Brown DWarf, Main Sequence, Super Giants and Hyper Giants.

Also verify  Hertzsprung-Russell(H-R) Diagram.
